#Reflection and New Digital Literacy
This class offered me allowed me work with many different technologies that I have never used. A lot of the tools that we learned in this class should be very helpful in working in technical writing and technology once I graduate. This class forced me to create project using tools that I have never used before. Most of my classes focuses on projects of writing, but this class allowed me to do a lot more then that. I really enjoyed the freedom I had with the projects we did. I was able to create the project by doing my own design and had the freedom to make it look how ever I wanted. This was both enjoyable and refreshing. This class allowed me to realize I enjoy doing stuff like this a whole lot more then writing 10 pages essays or research papers. I liked the freedom and creativity I had working in this class. 

As my site is hopefully able to demonstrate, I learned a lot of important skills that I think should be very helpful in my work life post college: Below are all the tools I learned, either for the first time, or gained a better understanding of.
* Html
* CSS
* Github
* Wordpress.com (and web-hosting services in general)
* DITA
* XML
* MkDocs

Aside from those tools that focus on mostly on creating products, this class also helped me to better understand how to work as a team. Our class was small so a lot of the stuff we worked on we worked in small groups to help each other out. It was very nice being able to see other people's process and help each other with any issues. Our client project also was huge in helping me understand how to work as a team with digital technologies. I developed a better understanding of project management. I have not worked with the type of tools and technologies that we did for that project, before. So it was nice to be able to use those instead of having to use them for the first time at work in the outside world. This

#Next Steps in Digital Literacy

As I get closer to the end of my last semester people keep asking me what's next? It's a fair question that I still don't have an answer to. This summer, while I look for jobs, I plan on exploring some online courses related to what we have learned in this class. I believe I have developed a pretty good understanding of HTML and CSS but would like to learn more about what goes into a website such as Javascript and jQuery, among others. I like believe that this class was the biggest step in my digital literacy narrative, up to this point, but it also also just the start. This class helped me to better understand my interests and possible change my future Digital Literacy Narrative will play out.
