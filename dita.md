#XML and Dita

Working with oxygen editor developed a project that consisted of: A concept topic, task topics, and a reference topic. The project was farely open-ended with what our topic could be so I chose how to fix a Keurig coffee maker. I chose something that would be easy to write about because the morning before one of our classes I spent awhile fixing my Keurig. My topic had enough different aspects of it that allowed me to complete all of the requirements and my final product was presented as a plain HTML site and as a PDF. Both of which can be found below. I found that the PDF document was much easier to create a working transformation and looks much better. Unfortunately my topic isn't something that would generally be found as a PDF, it is something that people would quickly google and click on the first webpage.

##What is Dita and XML?

Dita is an acronym that stands for 'The Darwin Information Typing Architecture.' It is a specification that defines a set of document types for authoring and organizing topic-orientated information. It was originally developed by IBM to more effectively reuse content in product documentation.

Dita is XML based. XML stands for 'Extensible Markup Language' and is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that can be read by both humans and computers.


##My Introduction to DITA

For me, this was the first time I had ever worked with something like Oxygen XML. It is pretty easy to pick up if you have experience with other tools for technical documentation. It seems like something that will be very useful once I enter the post-college life because it allows you to do outlines for technical documentation as well as many other tasks. The main issue with it was that it costs a lot of money to use each month, but luckily we were able to do our projects using a 30-day free trial.

My main issues with Oxygen and XML came from my computer. Apparently running Oxygen requires a lot of your disk space so I at times struggled to be able to run the program. This mostly came when I had other programs open, such as zoom during our class. This made me struggle a little bit since I wasn't always able to follow along in class but was able to quickly pick it up after. I also learned there are programs like Codex which are free, allow you to do most of the same things are oxygen, and run better on computers like mine.
