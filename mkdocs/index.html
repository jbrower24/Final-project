<h1 id="mkdocs">MkDocs</h1>
<p>This was our finally project and definitely the one that I struggle with most at first. This project required me to use programs and tools that I never had used before, and at first it seemed very different from the rest of the stuff we learn. For this project I used the terminal application for the first time, had to download python for the first time and wrote webpages completely in Markdown (.md) for the first time.</p>
<p>My biggest struggle was with getting mkdocs to work for the first time. I had no prior experience with terminal before so setting up my folder was a struggle. I wasn't familiar with any of the commands we needed, such as; cd(change directory), serve(run the live preview of the site), and mkdocs(how to access mkdocs + build to build the folder). I struggled with understanding how the site operates and how to make changes. This was my first time working with a .yml file so it was a little difficult to understand the structure of it and what to write so the site would work correctly.</p>
<p>While it was confusing at first, once I got the hang of the programs it was fascinating to see how it worked. MkDocs develops a live preview of the site your building so you can see all the changes you are making without having to wait or reload pages. MkDocs also comes with many different themes you can use so it is much easier to pick a theme when the site is auto-reloading as you save the files. Since it has its own themes that means that you don't need to work with any .css files, it does it all for you, so that makes mkdocs one of the easiest ways to build a site and display content.</p>
<p>For this project I don't have any sort of deliverables that I can link because what you reading this on is the project. The site was built using mkdocs and atom for writing the pages. I then uploaded it to Github where I was able to host it on Github pages, and you are now looking at the finished version. Since there is nothing for me to link on this page, below is some of the resources I found most useful.</p>
<h2 id="resources-i-used">Resources I used</h2>
<p>The best resource was obviously class time and seeing the demonstrations on how to set things up. It was also very useful to work through issues as small groups and help each other. Besides class and the class resources below are what I used outside of class to better understand mkdocs and complete this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">Mkdocs Website</a> - Their own website is built using mkdocs. On the site you'll find a lot of information that helps you learn how to run the program or smaller stuff like how to write the documents. It also has user guides for many different things you do with mkdocs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r-nbbTRCjQ&amp;ab_channel=EuroPython2014">Video walkthrough on how to document your project</a> - This video I found very helpful but also very interesting. It is a presentaion that the creator of mkdocs is giving, where he lays out how it works and helps you set it up, which is very helpful. It is also fascinating because he talks about how and why he created mkdocs and what its focus is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/">Mkdocs themes</a> - This is a page, hosted on Github, that lists many different themes that you can use on with mkdocs. You need mkdocs-bootstraps downloaded and at the top there is a break ddown of how to add that threw terminal. The theme I picked is called "Superhero" and there are about 20 more good choices. Changing the theme is very easy in the .yml file so it was nice being able to easily pick what looked best.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543587-Markdown-cheat-sheet">Markdown Cheat sheet</a> - This is very useful site that I kept returning to. It lays out a lot of different syntax references in the Markdown language. Since I didn't have a lot of experience with Markdown it was nice to have this handy for if I struggled.</li>
