# Welcome to My Site

My name is Josh Brower and I'm in my last semester at the University of Minnesota. I am studying Technical Writing and Communication and my sub-plan is information design and technology. This site was created for my class: WRIT 4662W - Writing with Digital Technology.

This site was compiled using MkDocs and contains all of the work I have done this semester. This site serves as a portfolio to show all of my work I have done as well as what I have learned.
