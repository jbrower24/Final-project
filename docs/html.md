#Working with HTML

The first major project we worked on was building a static site using HTML. I have built sites in the past, using HTML but this class is the first time I used HTML to the extent that I did. We built simple sites with a little bit of CSS for design and progressively learned more throughout the semester. Working on the sites also introduced me to Git and Github for the first time. Github is a site hosting provider for software development and version control. It was very easy to learn and became a very useful resource for hosing a site that allowed me to show off my work. Below you will find the sites I worked on are hosted using Github and the site you are currently on is too.

##My First Site
My first site was just a very basic introduction to HTML and CSS, for this semester. We just needed to create a site that a few HTML elements and some working CSS that is linked to the page. As you can see my site is very simple and I used it as a few to better understand HTML and CSS. I played around with it and just tried to see what I was capable of doing. As you can see, from the other sites below, I started to get better at setting up a webpage and the design of it.

##Working on a Template
The next project was actually our introduction to Github. We needed to be able to upload our work to Github as a repository and then host the site using Github pages. I started by uploading my original site that I created but also uploaded another site that worked on after the first project. The site below is one that started as a template from [HTML5](https://html5up.net/dimension). If you click on the link it will take you to the page I downloaded it from and you can see what it originally looked like. My version made a lot of changes that completely changed it the site. With this I again just wanted to play around with the HTML and CSS files and see what I could do. I focused on learning new things instead of creating a site to serve a purpose. You will see that the site doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is just random things thrown together. If you click around you will notice the things I added.

##Outside of class

Since I actually liked developing websites and working with HTML and CSS I wanted to try and push myself farther. I decided to do my capstone for this class and build a website. The site I am finishing up building is for one of the laboratories in the Department of Surgery. The bellow is an a template I created for the site before I added all of the content. I created this to figure out how I wanted the site to look before adding all the information and by having the template it would be easier to create the other nine pages. The final site will look slightly different since I still haven't decided on the fonts or added images, so that should change the spacing a little bit.

I think by comparing this site to some of the stuff I created earlier in the semester it shows just how much I have learned and how much more familiar I have become with different programs and languages we used in class.
