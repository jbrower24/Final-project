#Client Project

At about the midpoint of the semester we worked together, as a class, to resign a website for the Minnesota Austin-Healey Club. After looking at their [Current Site](http://www.mnhealey.com/MNHEALEY/index.htm) current website, it was clear that they needed a lot of changes to make it more user friendly and better visually. We worked together in groups to design the wireframe and then we used Wordpress to create the actual site.

##Wire-framing

There are many ways to create a wireframe with many different tools. Our group choose to do one fo the most simple ways and used Google Slides. This was simple because it allowed us to easily piece things together but it also was the easiest way for a group of six to work together. If you look at our [Wireframe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JPKKKepOleTZSXjxKZY3bOVeK0QM4xf3BzXoQNXmXEk/edit#slide=id.gbf039339aa_2_5) you can see what I mean by simple, it is most made up of text and shapes. This was to focus on the layout of the site and not worry about the design. This was an import part of our process and allowed us to lay out the site we wanted instead of just jumping right in to creating it.

##Wordpress

As a class we had to work together to decide on a web-hosting service for the site. Since we were creating the site, but not managing the site we needed to figure out what would be best for achieve our goals but also easiest for someone, not from our class, to manage. We settled on Wordpress.com.  

This was my first time working with Wordpress and found it was very easy to learn the basics and get a hang of. While it was easy to learn it also came with a lot of limitations. It is not the best for collaboration, only one person is able to edit a page at a time. Their are also a few things the creator of is only able to do, so since we were all working on different parts we had to have the site manager help us individually many times. I worked on a page all by myself but most of the pages were worked on by groups of two so the difficulty of collaborating was a big issue for them.

##Final Product  

Four this project I was in charge of working a creating the gallery. Their original gallery used a third-party site that looked poorly and was very difficult to navigate. I wanted to make sure I created a gallery that not only looked better but was much easier to use, so the club could show their large number of photos. Since they had so many photos I wanted the page to work as a gallery and a slideshow so they could easily look for specific photos or view them all as a slide show. Their originally one only worked as a slide show and didn't allow people to find specific photos easily. Below you will find our finished Wordpress site and it will open to the gallery page I initially created.

We all had individual parts of the site to work on but worked on some parts as a class. One of those was the layout and design. The layout was mostly decided through the wire framing but some of it needed to be adapted as the site progressed. As for the design we worked together to figure out the color scheme, fonts, images, videos, and many other things as a class. Everyone added their own input on how they see it looking. Since I worked on the gallery, I was also in charge of helping other groups find images that would work with their page.

In the end I was very pleased with the site and it seemed like the club was too, when we presented it to two of its members who requested the site. It is definitely a major upgrade from their original site. I am excited to see the site up and running after all of the work we put into it.
